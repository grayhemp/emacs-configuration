#+TITLE: Pyramidal
* Overview
Pyramidal is an effective words and phrases learning method. It
combines mnemonic techniques with continuous memorization extent
tests. The method assumes daily exercises of such length that is
convenient to a person itself. Pyramidal makes one to pay more
attention to words that are hard to memorize personally to him or
here.
* Usage notes
Schedule the test task daily and decide how many time you can afford
on it. 

Capture unknown words. It might be performed during the routine
activity. When capturing use the Pyramidal item in the capture
template dialog. These words are placed to the "0" outline of the test
task.

Doing the task start from the lowest number outline in it:
- if you can recall a word straight away move it to a higher number
  outline, if there is no higher outline move it to the end of the
  current one
- if you managed to recall a word but it required you long to do then
  move the word to the end of the current outline
- if you can not recall a word then move it to a lower outline, if
  there is no lower one then move it to the end of the list.

After collecting 25 items in the "0" level build a base image system
using the Cicero method and mnemonic. Describe it like a task and
schedule to repeat:
- after 1 hour
- then after 3 hours
- then after 1 day
- then after 3 days
- and finally after 1 week.

After the full circle of repeating free the base image by refilling
words to the "1" level outline.

The best options to obtain definitions is to use Google Definition
Search. Just search "word definition" in Google and copy the first
result. To get the ideas of words visualization use Google Image
Search. Search "word image" and enjoy.

If we are in the pyramidal buffer refiling works only within the
second level of the buffer.
