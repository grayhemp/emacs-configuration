* Test the business model
As a result you will check that the model works and exactly define an
minimum viable product (MVP).

1. Identify risks, uncertainties, unknowns
   - Find dubious items that are not clear or without proves
2. Select one thing at a time
3. State what you want to learn
   - Define exact questions to find answers for
4. Frame your hypotheses
   - Define the answers you would like to have
5. Design an experiment
6. Run the experiment
7. Measure the results
* Make a landing page
* Create a program
- Clean code that works for all use cases, with tests
* Make a business plan
* Create a product
- Design, copywriting, pricing, physical components
* Run the business
- Incorporation, regulatory ﬁlings, payroll, etc.
