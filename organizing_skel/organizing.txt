* Overview
The model is implemented as a convenient, simple and useful tasks
management model based on the essence from the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done][Getting Things Done]],
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique][Pomodoro Technique]] and Life Coaching methodologies. It is aimed for
feeling free and performing well when dealing with a lot of tasks and
complex projects. It is built around [[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][Emacs]] using [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]],
[[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/RememberMode][RememberMode]] and a set of rules.
* Getting Things Done
Here I described 5 general points of GTD adapted to the model. Note
what files I use for what purposes.

- Collect (capture) notes to the notes file when they appear during
  the day. Keep your mind free of them. Switch to the new task only if
  it is urgent.
- Process (refile) the collected notes in the morning next day. It is
  included into the daily review process.
  1. Get the task from the notes file and identify it (never return it
     back)
  2. If it requires an action write it down to the project file or to
     the tasks file so it gets to the common tasks stack
     - Do it straight away if it requires not more then 5 minutes
     - Assign it to your team if it is possible
     - Schedule it if it need to be done by a specific time
  3. If it does not require an action then move it to the journal,
     someday or trash file
- Organize things
  - All the stuff is organized in activity files
  - Projects are just the first level tasks that have subtasks. Active
    projects do not have any keyword.
  - Next actions are tasks with any active state. It is up to you to
    choose which one is the next in a project.
  - Deferred tasks are those that are delegated to others or required
    any external event to be resumed
  - Someday tasks are tasks to do in the future
  - Calendar events are appointments and other things that must be
    done in the specified time or periodically. It could never be next
    actions.
- Review the someday tasks weekly and notes daily, replace and
  reschedule them if it is needed
- Do all the actions like adding new tasks, moving them, marking, etc
  as quick as possible
* Natural Planning Model
It is used for tasks required more complex and deep development -
projects.

General points of the Natural planning model:

1. Define purpose and principles, note down what you want to do and why
2. Describe outcome, visualize the result of the task
3. Arrange a brainstorm, draw mind maps, generate an amount of ideas
   and reduce them according to the requirements
4. Organize the project into a structure, identify the resources,
   costs, people and skills needed
5. Identify the next action that you need to achieve the goal

Sometimes on some level of abstraction you do not have enough
information to describe an issue as a task that is ready to start
executing right now. Consider this task as a project and repeat steps
3-5 for it.
* Pomodoro Technique
GTD is good at organizing and planning but it has poor atomic time
management features. Pomodoro can fill the gaps. So here I would use
only the essence of the technique skipping organizing points.

The process is:

1. Set the countdown (pomodoro) timer to 25 minutes
2. Work on the task until the alert and note the progress and results
3. Take a break
   - 5 minutes for common break
   - 15â€“20 minutes for every fourth break
4. Repeat from the step 1
* Life Coaching
Fill the coaching review daily, just answer this question and correct
your way of doing things that day:

- What did I enjoy doing yesterday?
- What would I like to do more of?
- What would I like to do less of?
- What did I learn yesterday?
- What will I do differently today?
- Thought for the last day
* Org settings
See [[~/.emacs.d/organizing.el]].
* Org files
The files used in the model:

- [[file:notes.org][notes.org]] is the heap to capture issues
- [[file:routine.org][routine.org]] contains all the not categorized tasks
- [[file:project.org][project.org]] is a particular activity file
- [[file:journal.org][journal.org]] is a diary file
- [[someday.org]] contains ideas for future
- [[file:trash.org][trash.org]] is for useless things
- [[file:project.org_archive][project.org_archive]] is an archive file

Descriptive stuff except short notes is separated from organizing
files to text files.
* Task states
Default "TODO | DONE" workflow is extended with additional keywords.

For inactive tasks:

- ENTRUSTED is used when a task is delegated to somebody
- CANCELED
* Capturing issues
When capturing an issue it is allowed to create:

- Life Coach - the life coaching quiz, is captured into the journal
  file in a date tree
- Journal - thoughts in the date tree of the journal file
- Note - is captured into the notes file for the later processing
* Agenda files
I do not hard-code agenda files to the org-mode settings. Instead I
add them into the custom settings standard way. I added the files
below:

- The routine file
- All the activity and project files
* Refiling issues
When I process notes I correct purposes, set states and schedule
tasks. Then I refile it to the appropriate places. It is allowed to
refile to all the agenda files in addition to notes, someday and bin
files. The maximal level of refiling is 10.

If a task is on the level 1 and it has no state it might be considered
as an active project if it has subtasks. An active project is
considered as stuck if it has no tasks in active state.
* Project files
When processing notes or brainstorming something some issue could grow
into something more complex then just a task. In such cases I create
the separate project file for it and use the project template as the
pattern - [[file:project.org][project.org]]. After creating the project file I add it to the
agenda.
* Daily review
The daily review should be done daily before any other tasks. This is
a part of the organizing model. See the daily scheduled task in the
organizing file. I also use the org-checklist contrib to reset
checkboxes when marking the task as DONE.

The daily review includes the life coaching sub-task. This sub-task is
based on the remember template [[file:life-coach-template.txt][life-coach-template.txt]].
* Weekly review
The weekly review should be done every Monday before other tasks. It
is scheduled in the organizing file and uses org-checklist contrib to
reset checkboxes when marking the task as DONE.
* Pomodoro implementation
As the Pomodoro timer I use the standard org-mode countdown timer with
several customizations:

- Default countdown time is set to 25 min
- The countdown timer is started automatically when a task is clocking
  in, if it has not been started yet
- The timer is finished automatically when a task is clocking
  out. When finishing the timer it asks for a time interval of a
  break, 5 minutes by default.
- Raise X urgency hint and play sound after countdown done

Example things to do during a break:

- Yoga
- Read a book
- Darts
- Play a guitar
* Events reminder
For every issue containing an active time in agenda I configured the
system to raise X urgency hint and play sound every 3 minutes in the
15 minutes interval before this time.
